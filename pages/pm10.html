					<!-- Introduction -->
					<section>
						<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>This section presents an integrated analysis of PM₁₀ (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm) in Germany, focusing on three key aspects: land cover characteristics, annual variation in PM₁₀ concentrations, and population exposure based on spatial distribution in 2020. Combining geospatial data with environmental indicators, the analysis provides insights into air quality patterns and potential health impacts associated with particulate pollution.</p>

							<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<h3>Land Cover</h3>
								<p>Germany’s land use is predominantly agricultural (yellow), especially in the central, northern, and eastern regions. Forested areas (green) are extensive and mainly concentrated in mountainous southern and southwestern zones, including the Bavarian Alps and the Black Forest. Urban and peri-urban settlements (fuchsia) are densely distributed in major metropolitan areas such as Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, and the Ruhr region.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<h3>Environmental Relevance</h3>
								<p>This land cover distribution reflects a balance between agricultural production, natural vegetation, and urban development. Understanding these patterns is crucial for assessing air quality, as specific land use types (e.g., urban or agricultural areas) are often associated with elevated PM₁₀ levels due to anthropogenic emissions or dust resuspension.</p>

					<!-- Concentration Classifications -->
					<section>
						<h2>Concentration Classifications</h2>
						<p>PM₁₀ concentrations are categorized according to compliance with European Union (EU) limits and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. These classifications are fundamental for evaluating population exposure and associated health risks.</p>

						<div class="table-wrapper">
							<table>
								<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Class</th>
										<th>EU Limit (μg/m³)</th>
										<th>WHO Guideline (μg/m³)</th>
										<th>Health Risk</th>
									</tr>
								</thead>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td>1</td>
										<td>≤ 15</td>
										<td>≤ 15</td>
										<td>Good – meets WHO guideline</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>2</td>
										<td>15 – 30</td>
										<td>15 – 20</td>
										<td>Moderate – exceeds WHO guideline</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>3</td>
										<td>30 – 40</td>
										<td>20 – 30</td>
										<td>Unhealthy for sensitive groups</td>
									</tr>
									<tr>
										<td>4</td>
										<td>40 – 50</td>
										<td>30 – 50</td>
										<td>Unhealthy – approaching EU limit</td>

					<!-- Temporal Trends -->
					<section>
						<h2>Average and Maximum PM10 Exposure (2013-2022)</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<h3>Exposure Trends</h3>
								<p>The accompanying graph illustrates average and maximum PM₁₀ exposure levels in Germany from 2013 to 2022. The average exposure (blue line) shows a gradual decline, reflecting an overall improvement in air quality over the decade. Nevertheless, the average concentration remains above 15 µg/m³ throughout the period.</p>
								<p>Maximum exposure levels (orange line) display greater variability, with sporadic peaks exceeding 20 µg/m³. This indicates episodic pollution events despite the downward trend in average levels, highlighting the need to address acute air quality issues.</p>
								<p>Monitoring both average and peak exposures aids in identifying critical periods and locations where air quality management should be intensified.</p>

					<!-- Population Exposure -->
					<section>
						<h2>Population Exposure to PM10 Levels</h2>
						<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<h3>Exposure Distribution</h3>
							<p>The pie chart presents the distribution of the population according to their exposure to different PM₁₀ concentration classes. A large majority (96.6%, shown in blue) reside in areas with relatively low PM₁₀ levels, compliant with or close to health standards.</p>
							<p>Conversely, 3.4% of the population (highlighted in orange) live in regions with elevated PM₁₀ concentrations, which may pose increased health risks, especially in urban or industrial zones. This underlines the importance of targeted policies to protect vulnerable communities.</p>
							<p>These findings are critical for policymakers and public health officials to identify and prioritize interventions in high-risk areas.</p>

						<h2>Annual PM10 Difference: 2022 vs. 2017–2021 Average</h2>
						<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<h3>Key Observations</h3>
							<ul>
							<li>The majority of German regions experienced stable or decreasing PM₁₀ levels in 2022.</li>
							<li>Notable reductions occurred in northeastern and central-eastern areas.</li>
							<li>Localized increases were observed in southern and western parts, potentially linked to meteorological factors or localized emissions.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>This comparison facilitates long-term trend monitoring and assessment of policy impacts on air quality.</p>

								<h3>Bivariate Analysis</h3>
								<p>This bivariate map overlays PM₁₀ concentrations with population density in Germany (2020). Darker areas indicate zones with both high pollution levels and dense populations, typically found in industrial or urban centers such as the Ruhr region and some eastern cities.</p>
								<p>This visualization is instrumental for prioritizing areas that require focused environmental and public health interventions.</p>
