					<!-- Introduction -->
					<section>
						<h2>Overview</h2>
						<p>This section presents an integrated analysis of PM₁₀ (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤10μm) in Germany, focusing on three main dimensions: land cover characteristics, annual variation in PM₁₀ levels, and exposure risk for the population based on spatial distribution in 2020. The analysis combines geospatial data and environmental indicators to provide insights into air quality and the potential health impacts of atmospheric particulate pollution.</p>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<h3>Land Cover</h3>
								<p>Germany’s land use is predominantly agricultural (yellow), particularly in central, northern, and eastern regions. Forests (green) are widely spread and more concentrated in the mountainous southern areas and southwest (e.g., Bavarian Alps, Black Forest). Urban and peri-urban settlements (fuchsia) are dense in major metropolitan areas like Berlin, Munich, Hamburg, Frankfurt, and the Ruhr region.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
								<h3>Environmental Relevance</h3>
								<p>This landscape pattern reflects a balance between food production, natural vegetation, and urban development. Understanding land cover distribution is crucial for air quality assessment, as specific land types (e.g., urban or agricultural zones) correlate with higher PM₁₀ levels due to anthropogenic activities or dust emissions.</p>

					<!-- Concentration Classifications -->
					<section>
						<h2>Concentration Classifications</h2>
						<p>PM₁₀ levels are classified based on their compliance with EU and WHO air quality standards. These classifications are essential to assess population exposure and environmental risk.</p>

						<div class="table-wrapper">
							<table>
								<thead>

										<th>Class</th>

										<th>WHO Guideline (μg/m³)</th>
										<th>Health Risk</th>

										<td>≤ 15</td>
										<td>Good – meets WHO guideline</td>

						<h2>Average and Maximum PM10 Exposure (2013-2022)</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<h3>Trends in PM10 Exposure</h3>
							<p>The graph above shows the average and maximum levels of PM10 exposure between 2013 and 2022. The average PM10 exposure (blue line) demonstrates a gradual decrease over the years, indicating a general improvement in air quality. Despite this, the average level remains consistently above 15 µg/m³ up until 2022.</p>
							<p>The maximum exposure levels (orange line) fluctuate more significantly, with occasional peaks above 20 µg/m³. This variability suggests occasional episodes of high pollution, despite the overall downward trend in average concentrations. These peak values are a reminder that acute air quality issues still occur from time to time.</p>
							<p>Understanding the trends in both average and maximum exposure helps in identifying periods and areas where air quality management efforts need to be more focused.</p>

						<h2>Population Exposure to PM10 Levels</h2>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-6 col-12-medium">
							<h3>Distribution of Exposure Levels</h3>
							<p>The pie chart illustrates the distribution of the population exposed to different levels of PM10 concentrations. A significant portion of the population (96.6%, marked in blue) is exposed to relatively low levels of PM10, suggesting that most people live in areas with air quality that meets or is close to health standards.</p>
							<p>However, 3.4% of the population (represented in orange) experiences higher PM10 levels, which may pose health risks, particularly in certain urban or industrial regions. This indicates that while the majority of the population is exposed to safe air quality, there are critical areas where air pollution exceeds recommended levels, requiring targeted interventions.</p>
							<p>This data is essential for policymakers and public health authorities to identify vulnerable areas and populations that may need additional support and regulation.</p>

								<h3>Key Observations</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Most areas in Germany experienced stable or declining PM₁₀ levels in 2022.</li>
									<li>Significant reductions were recorded in parts of the northeast and central-east.</li>
									<li>Some localized increases appeared in southern and western regions, potentially due to meteorological conditions or industrial/local emissions.</li>
